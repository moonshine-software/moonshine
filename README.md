#### Hello Laravel user!

You are on an open source project dedicated to the "MoonShine" admin panel.

I've been working on it for several years, and have used it on dozens of small projects, constantly tweaking it.

What does moonshine mean? It's not exactly "moonlight" - my idea is the name "moonshine".
The term means the independent production of a drink in illegal conditions under the cover of night :).
So I developed this admin panel at night in my free time under the moonlight;)

Everything is already ready for use in your projects, documentation has been created describing the installation, configuration and features.

I invite interested users to use and develop Moonshine together.
